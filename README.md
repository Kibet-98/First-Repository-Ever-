# First-Repository-Ever-
This is my first ever repository on this platform, upon getting to know of it. 

My Name is Kibet Mutai Emmanuel, a student for life, an Art lover and creator. Born on the 21/09/199*, schooled and studied for a BSc in Actuarial Science and KASNEB professional Course (CIFA). Yet to be a practising Financial Analyst with ICIFA-Kenya, will be before the end of next year. Currently a student at ALX taking a 12 month program for Software Engineering. It's in my believe that as a Student Actuary and Financial Analyst, that a deep knowledge and broad understanding on matters to technology. More specifically, the FINTECH world.
